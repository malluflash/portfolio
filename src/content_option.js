  title: "THE JOURNEY SO FAR",
  aboutme: `I'm Harikrishnan—born in Malappuram, fueled by authentic Malabar Biriyani, and obsessed with making things work.

  My journey began in 2015 in the high-stakes world of Dubai logistics. For years, I managed shipping and land transport, but by 2019, I took a detour into manufacturing coordination, thinking I was done with operations.

  But the real plot twist came in 2020. I joined <b>Laundryheap</b> as an Operations Associate just as the world entered the Covid lockdowns. Riding the waves of the pandemic, the subsequent IT boom, and the AI revolution, I sprinted up the ladder—earning multiple promotions to become the **Driver Operations Manager**.

  However, as I scaled with the company, I realized that <b>logistics wasn't the problem—the manual processes were.</b>

  That realization was the spark. I picked up Al Sweigart's "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" to fix immediate bottlenecks. That curiosity quickly spiraled into a full-blown obsession. I swapped Python for JavaScript and transitioned from running scripts to building full internal systems. I became the operational <b>"go-to dev,"</b> often shipping custom solutions to complex problems in the company.

  Today, I'm a confident Web Developer and Vibecoder. I blend the precision of a logistician with the creativity of a frontend engineer, building apps that don't just function—they flow.`,
