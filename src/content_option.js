    aboutme: `The name is Harikrishnan, as you might have seen in the home page and maybe some other places üòú. 
    Born in Malappuram, Kerala as a typical Malabar Mallu who likes Biriyani more than anything üòÖ. 
    Basically, started out as a Logistician with a Shipping and Land transport company in Dubai right after my Business Management UG in 2015. 
    Left the company in 2019 thinking that I won‚Äôt do anything related to logistics operations again. 
    Joined a manufacturing company as a Project Coordinator in a Children Play Equipment company and then back to the Logistics Department, which is where I'm right now. 
    They however helped me to love the logistics operations again.
    I always had interest in learning programming and development. But did not get a chance to explore any languages properly until recently. 
    Started Python with the Great Al Sweigart‚Äôs Book ‚Äì ‚ÄúAutomate the boring stuff with Python‚Äù. After a point, I got bored of it and started learning Java Script.
    Still learning.....!`,
