# LinkedIn Post for Portfolio Website

---

🚀 Excited to share my new portfolio website!

After 9+ years in logistics operations—managing everything from shipping to driver operations at Laundryheap—I realized something: the complexity of operations wasn't the problem. Manual processes were.

That realization sparked a journey from operations to code. I started with Python automation, quickly fell in love with JavaScript, now building custom solutions for complex operational challenges.

Today, I blend the precision of a logistician with the creativity of a frontend engineer. I build web apps that don't just function—they flow.

My portfolio showcases projects ranging from full-stack React applications to workflow automations that eliminate hours of manual work. Each project reflects my philosophy: **Operations → Code → People**.

Check it out and let me know what you think!
